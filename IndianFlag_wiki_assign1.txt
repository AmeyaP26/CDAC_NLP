Usage of the flag is governed by the Flag Code of India and other laws relating to the national emblems. 
The original code prohibited use of the flag by private citizens except on national days such as the Independence day and the Republic Day. 
In 2002, on hearing an appeal from a private citizen, Naveen Jindal, the Supreme Court of India directed the Government of India to amend the code to allow flag usage by private citizens. 
Subsequently, the Union Cabinet of India amended the code to allow limited usage. 
The code was amended once more in 2005 to allow some additional use including adaptations on certain forms of clothing. The flag code also governs the protocol of flying the flag and its use in conjunction with other national and non-national flags.
